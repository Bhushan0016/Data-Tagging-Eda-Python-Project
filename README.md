# Data-Tagging-Eda-Python-Project
📘 Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for a two-part data analysis assignment focused on showcasing skills in data validation, cleaning, integration, free-text tagging, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

The project involved working on two tasks:

Task 1: Manual tagging of free-text data (Complaint, Cause, Correction) using a predefined taxonomy.

Task 2: Performing a full cycle of EDA and data preparation to generate actionable insights.

✅ Task 1: Data Tagging
🔹 Objective
To manually tag free-text data fields (Complaint, Cause, Correction) using a given taxonomy that included categories for:

Root Cause

Symptom_Condition

Symptom_Component

Fix_Condition

Fix_Component

📝 Deliverables
Tagged dataset in .csv format.

Summary report explaining the tagging methodology and insights.

💡 Key Highlights
Logical mapping of free text to taxonomy using contextual clues.

Addressed ambiguity with documented reasoning.

Identified patterns such as frequently occurring components and conditions.

✅ Task 2: Data Analysis & Insights Generation
🔹 Objective
To perform column-wise analysis, data cleaning, feature/tag generation from free text, and visualization using Python.

📊 Key Steps
Column-Wise Analysis

Data type identification, unique values, distributions, and relevance to stakeholders.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and corrected formats for numerical and categorical fields.

Critical Column Selection

Identified top 5 columns with high insight potential and visualized them (bar plots, count plots, etc.).

Tag Generation from Text

Extracted meaningful failure conditions and components from free text fields using simple NLP techniques.

Summary & Recommendations

Provided actionable insights and flagged data quality issues.

📈 Visualizations Included
Frequency distribution of key components and failures.

Correlation between failure types and fixes.

Distribution of complaints across categories.

💾 Tools & Libraries Used
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, re

Jupyter Notebook for scripting

Excel/Word/PDF for documentation

Power BI (optional) for enhanced visuals

🎯 Outcomes
Well-documented tagging logic and summary insights.

Clean and analysis-ready dataset.

Actionable insights for stakeholders such as frequent root causes and commonly replaced components.
